The year 2019 ended pretty well, I want to remember this moment, so that I will never forget them, as the saying goes “the best way to remember is to write”.
- I worked in different project personnel and professional.
- I volunteered on a project as maintainer and developer Full-Stack.
- I made a new friend in my current work he is the first friend who has a good IT background.
- I graduated with a great project that I didn't terminate (Shame on me and shame on the lack of assets).
- I enriched my developer skills and worked in extreme situation.
- I worked with nodejs. I’m saying this because I never thought that I will write a js code, but i did and it was a good experience.
- I developed an admin dashboard and it was a mess, after that I know that html and css are not my cup of coffee.

Hope this new year will be great for all of us, I will not set new year resolutions because the last time I did, I didn't achieve them so none for this year.
